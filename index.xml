      <description>My basket of article ideas is filled to the brim so it&amp;rsquo;s time to have a crack at emptying it out.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been intending to keep a blog for a while. While I&amp;rsquo;ve had numerous personal sites over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve never quite managed to keep them relevant or interesting for long. Part of that is down to being busy with life, but I also never felt qualified enough to contribute to the discourse online.</description>

      <description>I discovered this interesting study on arXiv about metalearning. It’s a fascinating glimpse into the future of machine learning and while I had been expecting this for a while, to finally see some solid research is amazing! The researchers evolve a bunch of convolutional neural networks using a genetic algorithm to create an optimal network for image classification. To understand what the heck I’m talking about, read on!
A bunch of animals.</description>
