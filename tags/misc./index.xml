      <description>My basket of article ideas is filled to the brim so it&amp;rsquo;s time to have a crack at emptying it out.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been intending to keep a blog for a while. While I&amp;rsquo;ve had numerous personal sites over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve never quite managed to keep them relevant or interesting for long. Part of that is down to being busy with life, but I also never felt qualified enough to contribute to the discourse online.</description>
